# Examples of code and configurations

Each subdirectory, summarised below, contains stand-alone example of configuration and/or source code. `bundles` is a special directory containing compressed files.

Directory | Contents
----------|-----------
`jasmine` | Maven project example for JavaScript testing using Jasmine test framework
`jasmine-saga` | `jasmine` plus code coverage using Saga
`jasmine-saga-sonar` | `jasmine-saga` plus exporting its results to SonarQube
`jasmine-karma-sonar-grunt` | Grunt project example for JavaScript testing using Jasmine, code coverage using Karma and exporting its results to SonarQube. It is, in a way, a Grunt project equivalent of `jasmine-saga-sonar`
`bundles` | Compressed files for each directory described above


While each example is self explanatory, [AHExamples blogs](http://ahexamples.blogspot.com.au) provides more elaborate descriptions and explanations as well as screen snapshots.
